        <p> I am one of the survivors from the Maze, whcih W.C.K.D put me and my friends into. I used to work for WICKED till they sent me in the box to the Glade. I was trapped there for months with my friends, trying to find a way out of the maze with one of my friend, Minho. We were both runners. We would enter the maze at sunrise, and return from the maze at sundown. We faced many difficulties trying to find a way out the maze, but Luckily we found a way out.
